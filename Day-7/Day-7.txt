-------------The Hangman Game-------------

Step-1: Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assing it to a variable called chosen_word. 
        Then print it.

Step-2: Ask the user to guess the letter and assing the letter to a variable called guess.
        Make guess lowercase.

Step-3: Check if the letter the user guessed is one of the letters in the chosen_word. 
        Print "Right" if it is present, "Wrong" if it is not.

Step-4: Create a empty string called placeholder.
        For each letter in the chosen_word add a  _ to the placeholder.
        So if the chosen word was apple the placeholder should be _ _ _ _ _ with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

Step-5: Create an empty string called display.
        Loop through each letter in the chosen_word.
        If the letter at that position matches guess then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
        e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen_word was apple,then display should be "_ p p _ _".
        Print display and you should see the guessed letter in the correct spot.
        But every letter that is not a match is represented with a "_"

Step-6: Use a while loop to let the user guess again.
        The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word.
        At that point, display has no more blanks "_". Then you can tell user they have won.

Step-7: Update the loop so that the previous guessue are added to the display string.
        At the moment when the user makes the new guess, the previous guess gets replaced by a "_". 
        We need to fix that by updating the loop.

Step-8: Create a variable called lives to keep a track of the number of lives left.
        Set lives to equal 6.

Step-9: If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word then reduce life by 1.
        If lives goes down to 0 then the game should end, and it should print you lose.

Step-10: Print the ASCII art from the list stages that correspond to the current number of lives the user has remaining.
